By default this comes with a MacOS executable. Simply go to the dist directory and load the executable on terminal.

For Linux and Windows, run `pyinstaller --onefile --name system_info_[OS] main.py` and replace `[OS]` with the operating system (Linux, Windows). You only need to do this once, and save it to the directory on the USB flash drive.
